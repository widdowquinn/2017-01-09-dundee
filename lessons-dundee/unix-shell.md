## Notes to accompany the Beginning the Unix Shell lesson.

### Getting Started

1. To start git-bash go to 'All Programs > School Software > General > Git-bash'

1. For Mac users go to 'Utilities > Terminal'

1. On git-bash startup the prompt is in /c/WINDOWS/system32. type ```cd``` to return to your home directory (H:) at 
``` /h ```

1. Download the [required data archive](lessons-dundee/shell-novice-data.zip) to your computer and extract it to the h:/Desktop directory. 
To extract the file, open a file browser, right click and select 7zip.

You should now have a folder called ```data-shell``` in your ```H:\Desktop``` folder and are ready to begin.

### Session 1 - Moving around

1. Your home directory on the University computers is ``` /h ```, not ```/Users/nelle```. 

### Session 2 - working with files

1. You will find Notepad++ at ```All Programs > Utilities & Accessories > Notepad++```

1. If you are using a Mac then ensure you use a text editor that saves as ASCII text, 
not in a formatted text (i.e. do not use Word)
